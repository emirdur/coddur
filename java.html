<pre id="editor">JAVA!
  Here is a brief summary of the Java programming language (feel free to experiment around!):
    Comments:
      To write in-line comments, use "//" followed by the comment.
      Open with "/*" and end with "*/" to write longer comments.

      // Commented Text

      /* 
        Longer Commented Text 
      */

    Errors:
      - compile-time: incorrect syntax (e.x. missing ;)
      - logical: problems with code itself (e.x. addition error)
      - run-time: no syntax error, but system detects an error (e.x. incorrect parsing of variable type)

    Printing:
      System.out.println("Hello World"); or System.out.print("Hello World");
      Use "+"" to concatenate strings while printing.
      Use "\"" as an escape sequence: System.out.println("Print \"Hello World\"");

    Variables:
      int - holds whole numbers
      int x = 3;

      floats - holds decimal values
      double x = 3.00;

      characters - store singular values
      char a = 'A';

      boolean - stores truth values (true or false)
      boolean t = True;

      strings - creates literal text
      String s = "Hello World";

    Math:
      Standard Operators:
        +, -, /, *, %
      Math Class Operators:
        abs(int/doube var) - takes the absolute value of a variable
        pow(double base, double exponent) - takes the base variable and raises it to the exponent variable
        sqrt(double var) - gives the positive value of the square root of a variable
        random() - returns a double value from 0 inclusive to 1 exclusive *you can multiply and/or add this by a value to expand the range
      Other:
        If you have a declared integer type, it will round the other values down to a whole number.
        You can use += to update a variable
        int x += 3; // assigns x to the previous value of x + 3

    Strings:
      String s = "I am a string!";
      String Operators:
        String(String str) - constructs a new String object with the stored variable str 
        length() - returns the length of the String
        substring(int from, int to) - returns the substring from the index value of integer from inclusive to the index value of integer to exclusive
        indexOf(String str) - returns the index of the first found substring str within the string, and returns -1 if isn't found
        equals(String new) - returns true if String new is equal to the previous String and false otherwise
    
    Conditionals:
      if (False) {
        return "This will be returned if the parameter in the if statement is true";
      } else if (True) {
        return "Sadly, the above if statement ha a parameter that wasn't true, so we move on... This one returns true, so it will return this statement.";
      } else {
        return "If both were false, it would return this (also known as a default case";
      }
      *Note how if statements are stacked, e.g. if we have multiple if statements being true, it will evaluate each individual if statement; 
       however, if we have an if statement (happens to be true) and then an else if statement, it will only evaluate the if statement.
    
    Loops:
      boolean x = True;
      while (x) {
        return "This will return so long as the parameter in the while loop is true";
        x = False; // we usually want to change values so that the condition is met and we can avoid an infinite loop
      }
      *Use these when you aren't certain how many times you want something to iterate

      int y = 100;
      for (int i = 0; i < y; i++) {
        return "This will return 100 times!";
      }
      *Notice how we know how many times we want this to iterate, so we naturally use for loops when we know how many times it will iterate!

    Truth Values:
      && - and, checks if each condition is met
      || - or, checks if one or another condition is met
      ! - not, checks if a condition isn't met
      DeMorgan's Law:
      Basically negates everything and flips and and or, as well as greater/less than signs (adds an equal sign to it if it was without an equal sign before).

    Classes: 
      public class Food { //name your class something useful
        private String ingredient1;
        private String ingredient2; //known as instance variables

        public Food(String ingredient1, String ingredient2) { //this is your constructor
          this.ingredient1 = ingredient1;
          this.ingredient2 = ingredient2;
        }

        public String cook(String ingredient1, String ingredient2) { //this is a method
          return ingredient1 + " with " + ingredient2;
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) { //a tester for your code!
          String rice = "Rice";
          String chicken = "Chicken";
          Food f = new Food(rice, chicken); //creates an object
          System.out.println(f.cook());
        }
      }
    
    Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D Arrays:
      Arrays:
        int[] nums = new int[3]; //creates an array with 3 empty elements
        int[] nums2 = {0, 1, 2}; //creates an array with 3 elements with values 0, 1, and 2
        Access a value using nums[index] and use .length to find the size of the array
        *Indexes start from 0 and go to the length of the list - 1 and arrays are immutable, meaning you can't add elements to it

      ArrayLists:
        ArrayList<int> nums3 = new ArrayList<int>();
        *ArrayLists are basically the same as arrays, except that they can be mutated, meaning you can delete/add elements to it
        .size() - gets the size of the ArrayList
        .add(int index, O object) - adds an element to the specified index
        .get(int index) - gets the element at the specified index
        .set(int index, O object) - changes the element at the specified index to the element
        .remove(int index) - removes the element at the specified index
        .clear() - removes all the elements of the ArrayList
      
      2D Arrays:
        Similar to arrays, we can make 2D Arrays:
          int[][] nums4 = new int[2][2];
          int[][] nums5 = {{0, 1}, {2, 3}};
        These arrays again start at 0, both vertically and horizontally; treat it as a square

    Inheritance:
      Inheritance is the idea of using subclasses and superclasses
      extends - used in a class declaration, and inherits from another class
      implements - keyword to include an interface
      Polymorphism means having many classes, which are linked via inheritance
      *The idea is that you can use methods and variables from superclasses

    Recursion:
      base condition - a condition that will basically end the recursive calls
      Similar to for loops, recursion is a way to loop a task a certain amount of times by calling the same method
      *Don't forget to change the value related to the base case to prevent infinite loops
      
    Sorting and Searching Algorithms:
      Sequential Search - searches each element in the list until it finds the corresponding item
      Binary Search - starts from the middle and divides the list; proceeds to go to the left or right list depending on lower or higher respectively; 
                      only works with sorted list
      Merge Sort - splits array into two until single elements; compares values and places them together; repeats this until merged into one list
      Insertion Sort - splits array into sorted and unsorted part; places each element from unsorted part into corresponding spot; 
                       repeats process till the end of the list
      Selection Sort - finds minimum element and places it in the correct index of the list; repeats till the end of the list
